			tclabc - 0.18.13
			================

tclabc is designed to help on writing music in ABC notation, especially on
Unix systems. It requires Tcl/Tk (8.0 or newer), and a C compiler.

It contains two main parts:

  - a Tcl extension, written in C, which translates ABC to/from
    TCL variables, and helps for tune navigation/modification.

  - a Tk graphical interface which permits creation or modification
    of tunes, using the previous extension.


Installation
============

tclabc uses the standard GNU configure scheme, so, after untaring, run
'./configure', 'make'  and then 'make install'.

If Tcl/Tk is not at a standard place (/usr or /usr/local), use the option
'--with-tcltk=' with the directory where the file 'tclConfig.sh' is installed.

Example:
	./configure -with-tcltk=/usr/share/tcltk/tcl8.3/
	make
	make install

Before 'make install', you may try the GUI in the installation
directory by:
		wish tkabc.tcl

Win32 users without the GNU tools should compile the tclabc.dll from
all .c files and run tkabc.tcl from the installation directory.


Usage
=====

When installed, start the GUI calling 'tkabc' with 0 or 1 argument.
If present, the argument must be an ABC or MIDI file name.

To use the tcl extension, load it into tclsh or wish from its installation
directory in a normal way ('load', 'package require'... - have a look at
the script 'tkabc' or at one of the example scripts).


Scripts
=======

As examples in using the tclabc library, I included the following tcl
scripts:

- abcbarchk: Check if there is a correct number of notes per measure.

- abctrans: Transpose ABC tunes.

- mid2abc: Convert MIDI files to ABC.


Current status
==============

The actual version is still basic, but evolves as I have some time...

Important: as the program does not implement all ABC features, some
information may be lost on tune saving.
