<h1>MIDI keyboard</h1>

The MIDI keyboard works only when you have a MIDI keyboard connected to
a sound board on Linux/FreeBSD. If you have not such a configuration
but you want to use the virtual piano keyboard, please, read the following
lines.

<h2>Keyboard entry mode</h2>

This mode permits to enter music elements without time constraints.
<p>
It is activated when the virtual piano is displayed.
<p>
Pressing a key generates a note. The note length depends on the pressing
duration, as if the tempo was 60 beats/mn, i.e. pressing a key for 1 second
gives a crotchet.
<p>
The lowest keys have special meanings:
<dl>
  <dt>C
  <dd>Generate a rest.
  <dt>C#
  <dd>Generate a bar (note length doesn't matter).
</dl>

<h2>Recording mode</h2>

This mode is activated from the graphical interface or by the key <b>r</b>.
<p>
Effective recording starts on the first MIDI event. At the end of
recording, the MIDI events are translated to ABC and inserted in
the current tune.

<h1>Virtual piano keyboard</h1>

The virtual piano keyboard offers 4 octaves and its behaviour is the
same as the MIDI keyboard.
<p>
It also accepts events from the computer keyboard. Each keyboard row gives
different octave: the upper row (digits) gives the higher pitches. On a row,
each key is a half-tone distance from the next one. For example, with a US
keyboard, 'A' gives the middle C, and 'K' is G, and the lowest notes ('Z'
and 'X') generate a rest and a bar.
<p>
There may be problems while key repeat is enabled. On X window systems,
it's safe to disable it with the command <i>xset r off</i>.
<p>
To remove the virtual keyboard, just press <i>Escape</i>.
