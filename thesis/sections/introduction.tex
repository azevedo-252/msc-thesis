\section{Summary}

Currently, there are tools that process \abc{} with specific purposes as well as big software
packages that integrate a lot of features (some of them are described in \ref{sec:projects}),
however there's always the need for processing music, this is, making custom modifications to the
original \abc{}, producing some sort of information, integrating existing tools, etc...

Therefore, what's being proposed in this dissertation is an \ac{OS} comprised of simple tools for
generic \abc{} processing which can be composed with each other, and a versatile environment to
create new tools through a compact \ac{DSL} embedded in Perl.
