[[http://www.lucytune.com/|LucyTuning]] LucyTuning is a musical microtuning system. This system enables users to modulate and transpose using any scales or keys that they may choose. with LucyTuning, it is possible to emulate Japanese, Indonesian, Chinese, Indian, Arabic (makam) and any conceivable tuning system.

[[http://www.vexflow.com/|vexflow]] VexFlow is an open-source web-based music notation rendering API. It is written completely in JavaScript, and runs right in the browser.
	Implica conhecimento Javascript.
	Para fazer uma pauta vazia apenas com uma clave de sol sao preciso 5 linhas de código
	Existe uma versao mais alto nivel (parece-me que é mais indicada para tablaturas) → VexTab is a language that allows you to easily create, edit, and share guitar tablature. Unlike ASCII tab, which is designed for readability, VexTab is designed for writeability.
	Talvez seja interessante integrar na wikiscore, mas para já não me parece algo essencial.


== Computer-aided musical analysis ==
[[http://mit.edu/music21|music21]] Music21 is a Python-based toolkit for computer-aided musicology.
	Applications of this toolkit include computational musicology, music informations, musical example extraction and generation, music notation editing and scripting, and a wide variety of approaches to composition, both algorithmic and directly specified.
	A general-purpose, open source toolkit for analyzing, searching, and transforming symbolic music data.
	(e.g., reducing scores to a series of chords, determining key or metrical strength automatically, or integrating audio data)
	music21 presently supports import of Humdrum and its Kern format, MIDI, and **ABC**, as well as export of MIDI and Lilypond. MuseData and additional formats will be forthcoming.
