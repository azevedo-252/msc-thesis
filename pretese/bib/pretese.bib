  abstract = {This work, which has become a classic in music theory since its publication in 1983,
    models music understanding from the perspective of cognitive science. The point of departure is
      a search for a grammar of music with the aid of generative linguistics. The theory, which is
      illustrated with numerous examples from Western classical music, relates the aural surface of
      a piece to the musical structure unconsciously inferred by the experienced listener. From the
      viewpoint of traditional music theory, it offers many innovations in notation as well as in
      the substance of rhythmic and reductional theory.},

  abstract = {L-Systems have traditionally been used as a popular method for the modelling of space-
    filling curves, biological systems and morphogenesis. In this paper, we adapt string re- writing
      grammars based on L-Systems into a system for music composition. Representation of pitch,
    duration and timbre are encoded as grammar symbols, upon which a series of re-writing rules are
      applied. Parametric extensions to the grammar allow the specification of continuous data for
      the purposes of modulation and control. Such continuous data is also under control of the
      grammar. Using non-deterministic grammars with context sensitivity allows the simulation of
      Nth-order Markov models with a more economical representation than transition matrices and
      greater flexibility than previous composition models based on finite state automata or Petri
      nets. Using symbols in the grammar to represent relationships between notes, (rather than
          absolute notes) in combination with a hierarchical grammar representation, permits the
      emergence of complex music compositions from a relatively simple grammars.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the issues in the design of a representational system for
    music. Following decisions as to the primitives of such a system, their time structure and
      general structuring is discussed. Most of the issues are presented as controversies, using
      extremes to clarify the underlying problems. Associating time intervals and their constraints
      with the components of musical structure turns out to be essential. These constraints on time
      intervals model an important characteristic of musical knowledge and should be part of the
      representation, i.e. part of the syntax. It is concluded that a representation of music
      should, in the short run, be made as declarative, explicit and formal as possible, while
      actively awaiting representation languages that can deal with the presented issues in a more
      flexible way.},

@article{Hamanaka2006,
  abstract = {This paper proposes a music analysing system called the automatic time-span tree
    analyser (ATTA). ATTA derives a time-span tree that assigns a hierarchy of \&ldquo;structural
      importance\&rdquo; to the notes of a piece of music based on the generative theory of tonal
      music (GTTM). Although the time-span tree has been applied in music summarization and
      collaborative music creation systems, these systems use time-span trees manually analysed by
      experts in musicology. Current systems based on GTTM cannot acquire a time-span tree without
      manual application of most of the rules, since GTTM does not resolve much of the ambiguity
      involved in the application of the rules. To solve this problem, we propose a novel
      computational model of GTTM that re-formalizes the rules through a computer implementation.
      The main advantage of our approach is that we can introduce adjustable parameters, which
      enables us to assign priorities to the rules. Our analyser automatically acquires time-span
      trees by configuring the parameters that cover 17 out of 26 GTTM rules for constructing a
      time-span tree. Experimental results show that after these parameters were tuned, our method
      could outperform a baseline performance. We hope to distribute the time-span tree analyser as
      a tool for various musical tasks, such as searching and arranging music.},

      artificial music critics,which may be trained on large music corpora, and then pass aesthetic
      judgment on music artifacts. Music artifacts are generated by an evolutionary music composer,
    which utilizes music critics as fitness functions. To evaluate this approach we conducted three
      experiments. First, using music features based on Zipf’s law, we trained artificial neural
      networks to predict the popularity of 992 musical pieces with 87.85\% accuracy. Then, assuming
      that popularity correlates with aesthetics, we incorporated such neural networks into a
      genetic-programming system, called NEvMuse. NEvMuse autonomously “composed” novel variations
      of J.S. Bach’s Invention \#13 in A minor (BWV 784), variations which many listeners found to
      be aesthetically pleasing. Finally, we compared aesthetic judgments from an artificial music

    Within Western tonal music, from the early Baroque on to modern-day jazz and pop music, the
      function of chords within a chord sequence can be explained by harmony theory. Although
      Western tonal harmony theory is a thoroughly studied area, formalising this theory is a hard
      problem. We present a formalisation of the rules of tonal harmony as a Haskell (generalized)
      algebraic datatype. Given a sequence of chord labels, the harmonic function of a chord in its
      tonal context is automatically derived. For this, we use several advanced func- tional
      programming techniques, such as type-level computations, datatype-generic programming, and
      error-correcting parsers. As a detailed example, we show how our model can be used to improve
      content-based retrieval of jazz songs. We explain why Haskell is the perfect match for these

  abstract = {For more than twenty years1 musicologists have used the computer in a wide variety of score analysis tasks. Most of these studies have been designed on an ad hoc basis, lacking any sense of cohesion when compared one against another. It might have been thought that the development of the now-standard music encoding languages2 would have altered this state of affairs. But the design and implementation of auxiliary software tools has been slow in coming, thus standing as a major obstacle to meaningful progress. It is felt that a series of case studies might be useful in this regard, serving to illustrate how one or more musical analysis projects is carried to completion, from which one might be able to generalize. If the software tools developed in these studies is then given a closer scrutiny, common principles can be expected to emerge, and a systematic methodology may yet be an achievable goal. Such case studies need not be entirely representative of any complete analytical discipline, but only need capture the spirit of the particular field of inquiry, whatever it may be. From the point of view of the explication alone, it is necessary to limit the attention to a particular musical form and its unique harmonic system, and no apologies are made in choosing the American popular song.3 In fact it is seen that the unusual restrictions of this idiom—32 measures in major key, common time and “seventh chord” harmonization, all serve to advance the pur- poses of a meaningful case study, while limiting the focus at a manageable level. We believe the presentation will be useful in providing a concrete realization of the manipulatory functions that a music software system must offer, whatever the application—from the encoding, through the internal computer representation structures, their access and traversal, to the design and development of the software tools specific to a particular analysis task.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses a new approach for clustering sequences of bar-long percussive and bass-line patterns in audio music collections and its application to genre classification. Many musical genres and styles are characterized by two kinds of distinct representative patterns, i.e., percussive patterns and bass-line patterns. So far, in most automatic genre classification systems, rhythmic and bass melody information has not been effectively used. In order to extract bar-long unit rhythmic patterns for a music collection, we propose a clustering method based on one-pass dynamic programming and k-means clustering. For clustering bass-line patterns, a method based on k -means clustering capable of handling pitch-shifting is proposed. After extracting these two fundamental kinds of patterns for each style/genre, feature vectors which are suitable for representing information about the patterns are proposed for supervised learning. Experimental results show that the automatically calculated rhythmic pattern information and bass pattern information can be used to effectively classify musical genre/style and improve upon current approaches based on timbral features.},

It argues that the structure of harmonic progressions exceeds the simplicity of the Markovian transition tables and proposes a set of rules to account for harmonic progressions with respect to key structure, functional and scale degree features as well as modulations. Harmonic structure is argued to be at least one subsystem in which Western tonal music exhibits recursion and hierarchical organization that may provide a link to overarching linguistic generative grammar on a structural and potentially cognitive level.},

For example, in a statistical study by Rohrmeier of the frequencies of diatonic chord progressions in Bach chorales, chord II was five times more likely to follow chord IV than to precede it; chord I followed chord V twice as often as preceding it, and so on. This research draws together two existing lines of research with the aim of showing how local and possibly global dependency relationships specified in Rohrmeier's generative grammar may be linked to and supported by chord attraction levels as specified in Woolhouse's pitch attraction model. It is argued that, to a significant degree, the transitional regularities of chords in tonal music can be explained and understood in terms of generative rules of tonal harmony and pitch attraction. Empirical evidence is provided which supports the notion that chord transition asymmetries in Bach chorales are linked to chord attraction, mediated by an underlying syntactic process.},

The GTTM is considered one of the most promising theories of music in regard to computer implementation; however, no order is given for applying its rules and as a result, they frequently conflict with each other. To solve this problem, we introduced adjustable parameters, enabling us to assign priority to the rules. Our GTTM-based system makes it possible to construct hierarchical metrical structures in a top-down process using bottom-up detection of local metrical strength. Experimental results showed that after these parameters were tuned, our method outperformed the baseline performance. 1.},

(Some special mathematical care must be taken to allow for music that momentarily stops, instantaneously skips ahead, or is allowed to jump backwards, but we will ignore these details.) One practical representation of the beat-to-time function is the set of times of individual beats. For example, a performer can tap beats in real time and a computer can record the time of each tap. This produces a finitely sampled representation of the continuous mapping from beats to time, which can be interpolated to obtain intermediate values. MIDI Clocks, which are transmitted at 24 clocks per quarter note, are an example of this approach. The Mockingbird score editor Maxwell 84 interface also supported this idea. The composer would play a score, producing a piano-roll notation. Then, downbeats were indicated by clicking with a mouse at the proper locations in the piano roll score....},

Any language extensions implemented using abc should follow the same principles. We have based our implementation on Polyglot, starting with the base Java compiler. The scanner is an extended version of polyglot’s base Java scanner. The main difference is that the abc scanner uses states to distinguish between different contexts.

The harmonic similarity is determined by finding and examining the largest labeled common embeddable subtree (LLCES) of two parse trees. For the calculation of the LLCES a new O(min(n,m)nm) time algorithm is presented, where n and m are the sizes of the trees. For the analysis of the LLCES we propose six distance measures that exploit several structural characteristics of the Combined LLCES.

Music segments are also decomposed according to time segments obtained from the beginning, middle and end parts of the original music signal (time-decomposition). The final classification is obtained from the set of individual results, according to a combination procedure. Classical machine learning algorithms such as Na\"{\i}ve-Bayes, Decision Trees, k Nearest-Neighbors, Support Vector Machines and Multi- Layer Perceptron Neural Nets are employed. Experiments were carried out on a novel dataset called Latin Music Database, which contains 3,160 music pieces categorized in 10 musical genres. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble approach produces better results than the ones obtained from global and individual segment classifiers in most cases. Some experiments related to feature selection were also conducted, using the genetic algorithm paradigm. They show that the most important features for the classification task vary according to their origin in the music signal.},

Music corpora of Irish, German and Austrian folk music in various symbolic formats were used as the data set. Different representations and HMM structures were tested and compared. The classification performances achieved 75\%, 77\% and 66\% for 2-way classifications and 63\% for 3-way classification using 6-state left-right HMM with the interval representation in the experiment. This shows that the melodies of folk music do carry some statistical features to distinguish them. We expect that the result will improve if we use a more discriminable data set and the approach should be applicable to other music classification tasks and acoustic musical signals. Furthermore, the results suggest to us a new way to think about musical style similarity.},

The data structure is a doubly linked ring structure in which the score is treated as a sparse matrix with rows referenced by part number and columns by elapsed time in the score. The structure supports special cases such as chords and multiple layers within parts, and scores of virtually any complexity can be represented. This scheme makes segmentation of a score by part or vertical sonority trivial, and facilitates implementation of much more complex analytical algorithms. The input data to the procedure that builds this structure is the output from a DARMS interpreter that translates DARMS-encoded scores into a more accessible from (see "A Design for a Single-Pass Scanner for the DARMS Coding Language," Proceedings of the 1983 ICMC). The procedure takes notes and events in any order and links them into the data structure in the correct vertical and temporal position. Pointers to the data structure are then passed to the procedures which implement analytic tasks. Writing analysis programs is facilitated by functions that return attributes of notes (pitch class, spelling, octave, duration, dynamic level, etc.) or find specified locations in the structure.},

  abstract = {The music classification techniques can be discriminated into two categories - based by music content-based classification and training by learning machine classification. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. For music content-based classifications, most of the approaches are based on single music feature, such as melody or chord, and the accuracy is up to 70\% in few genres of music. However, the accuracy for classification of most music genres is lower. In this paper, we study the features of music content and use the multiple features of music data to improve the accuracy of music classification. Our performance studies shown that the higher accuracy can be achieved for classification of classical music by using multiple features of music content for classification.},

  abstract = {Traditional software synthesis systems, such as Music V, utilize an instance model of computation in which each note instantiates a new copy of an instrument. An alternative is the resource model, exemplified by MIDI ‘‘mono mode’’, in which multiple updates can modify a sound continuously, and where multiple notes share a single instrument. We have developed a unified, general model for describing combinations of instances and resources. Our model is a hierarchy in which resource-instances at one level generate output which is combined to form updates to the next level. The model can express complex system configurations in a natural way.},

The toolkit aims to pro- vide powerful software tools integrated with sophisticated musical knowledge to both musicians with little pro- gramming experience (especially musicologists) and to programmers with only modest music theory skills. This paper introduces the music21 system, demon- strating how to use it and the types of problems it is well- suited toward advancing. We include numerous examples of its power and flexibility, including demonstrations of graphing data and generating annotated musical scores.},

  abstract = {A large-scale study is reported whose purpose was to attempt to elucidate the
    emergence of the European major-minor system from the earlier system of modes.  The study
      involved 455 musical passages by 259 composers sampled across the years 1400 to 1750.
      Beginning with the period 1700-1750, a series of statistical studies were carried out on the
      distribution of scale tones, progressively moving backward in time.  The method utilized a
      modiﬁed version of the Krumhansl-Schmuckler method of key determination – generalized to
      handle an arbitrary number of modal classiﬁcations.  The results from cluster analyses on this
      data are consistent with the view that the modern minor mode emerged from the amalgamation of
      earlier Dorian and Aeolian modes, with the collapse being completed around the late sixteenth
      century},

    corpus, and the constituents of it, texts themselves, noting briefly the pragmatic constraints on
      the sort of documents which will actually be available, spoken as well as written. It then
      (Section 2) reviews the practical stages in the process of establishing a corpus, from selection
      of sources through to mark-up, assigning annotations to the texts assembled. This is followed by
      a consideration of copyright problems (Section 3). Section 4 points out the major difficulties
      in defining the population of texts that the corpus will sample, contrasting the sets of texts
      received versus those produced by a target group, and internal (linguistic) versus external
      (social) means of defining such groups. The next three sections look at the sets of markers
      which can be useful at different levels Section 7 begins at the highest level, considering the
      different types of corpus there may be. Section 6 is intermediate, considering how to
      distinguish the different types of text occurring within a corpus. Then, for the intra-text

          from the corpus design itself, to focus on its social context and function, both of the
          corpus design process, and of the corpus when implemented: to what extent are there now
          accepted standards relevant to the criteria reviewed in preceding sections? And what are the
          major classes of potential users and uses for corpora, both now and in the future?},
