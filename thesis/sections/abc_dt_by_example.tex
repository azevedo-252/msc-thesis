This chapter presents examples of \abcpt{}s created using \abcdt{}, thus demonstrating how easily a
(simple) tool or some occasional processing can be done. Some of the tools presented are an
extension of those presented in the article~\cite{Azevedo2013} submitted and accepted to
\emph{SLATE'13}'s conference.

The tools presented here are merely a proof of concept of what can be done with \abcdt{}, therefore,
they only provide a limited number of features and can be further improved in the future. However,
as they are, some of them have already proven their worth, consult chapter
\ref{chap:test_eval}.

Every \abcpt{} created performs at least one traversal to an \abc{} \ac{IR} (through \dt{}). So, in
order to facilitate the \abcdtrules{} readability for each \dt{} call, a tabular format will be
used, in which each row describes a single \abcdtrule{}.
