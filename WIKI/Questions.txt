**Q:** 
Hello!
My name is Bruno Azevedo and I'm a msc student of Informatic Engineering.
My thesis involves having an internal representation of abc scores so that i can work around with them. The parser needs to be robust so that it can antecipate any future changes to the abc notation.
I would like to know your opinion about what I should do. 
	* Should i study a few existing parsers like those from abcmidi, abcm2ps, music21, abc2xml/xml2abc and using them as a starting point, build my own parser removing or adding features that best suit my needs? 
	* Should I build a new one from scratch, using tools like flex and yacc and build my own internal representation.
If you have any other suggestions regarding the best approach to solve my problem I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Bruno

**Q:** 
Hello again,
I'm still working with your parser and I have a few questions regarding the internal representation:
* is there a function that given the structures generated by the parser (an abctune) transforms them into a structure more oriented to be, in the case of abcm2ps, "printed" into PostScript? I mean, do you only use abctune a it is to get all the information need for "printing" or is there another one more suited to it? For instance I want to navigate through a structure that is part-wise, in other words, a structure that allows me to navigate through the music belonging to a specific voice.
* do the existing generated structures by the parser allow generating abc  as it was in the input? I mean, do they possess all the information needed to do such task?
One more question regarding abcsym:
* in abc what maps to mrep (measure repeat)?
Until now, I've analyzed the struct abctune and all it's inner structs and attributes, my next step will be using those generated structures and generate something that perl can process, like a perl hash or something. Having that perl structure I can apply some scripting and extract some statistics for example.

Hello again.
My name is Bruno Azevedo and I'm a MSc in Informatics Engineering student.
We've exchanged some emails three months ago regarding abcm2ps.

I'd like to know if there is any piece of code in acbm2ps or other programs like tclabc related to the counting of the duration of each note. In case there is none, how would you approach this matter, specially when the notes belong to a tuplet?

By the way, is there any place where you need to keep record of a score's offset, i mean, how many time units (perhaps a quarter length) have passed since the beggining of the score?

Thanks,
Bruno

**Q:**
Hello again.
My name is Bruno Azevedo and I'm a MSc in Informatics Engineering student.
We've already exchanged some emails regarding abcm2ps.

I'd like to know if you calculate the metrical accent of a note in any application you've made so far. I mean the the beat of a note in the context of a particular measure. Moreover, I'd like to know if you can distinguish a strong a beat from a weak one.
For instance, with a time signature 4/4, the second quarter note has a beat of 2 and it is considered a weak beat, while beats 1 and 3 would be considered strong ones.

Thanks,
Bruno
