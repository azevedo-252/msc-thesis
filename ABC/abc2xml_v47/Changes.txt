Version 40
- when reading a file with multiple tunes only translate the first one
- command line option added for scale, page size and margins

Version 36
- volta-stop elements were somtimes (recognised at and) put into a left-bar element, which
is not valid MusicXML. These elements are now put into the right-bar of the previous measure.
- accept volta's without barline: "abc [1 def" is read as: "abc |[1 def"
- accept volta's after redundant left barline: "abc |\n|[1 def" is read as "abc |\n[1 def"
- changed document order of repeat and ending elements (MusicXML order requirement)
- xml output to stdout is also encoded in utf-8 (was erroneously done in latin-1)
- prevent finale detecting the string "xml" in the <software>-tag (finale quirk)

- silently skip slur end when there is no corresponding slur begin

- recognize, warn and skip misplaced accidentals and ties
- bug in old style continuation when there was nothing left to continue with.
- limit syntax error output to 80 chars, with error in the middle.

Version 33

- combine ~-syllabi (multiple syllabi under one note)
- skip W: lyrics because no musicXML equivalent
- translate longa and breve

Version 31
- bug in treatment of double-repeat when it is at the end of a voice-lyrics block
- added <DOCTYPE> declaration because Finale seems to need it.
- added identification/encoding element so people can see what software made the file

Version 30
- voice overlays
- merging voices rewritten: lyrics renumbering, measurewise merging
- linebreak after left-bar is output directly (i.e. not postponed to the next measure)

Version 29
- implementation of beaming
- insert line breaks at start of next measure
- keep only one line break per measure when mapping multiple voices
- renumber slurs when clash occurs during voice mapping
- syntax error message is encoded in latin-1
- bug in recognition of presence of open tie

Version 28
- all chord symbols were erroneously recognized as text annotations (wrong syntax priority)
- Recognize (and skip) redundant left side bars
- don't stumble on a double repeat (::) when it occurs at the and of a voice/lyrics block
- better error message when header fields appear after the first K:
- output of non latin-1 strings on stderr uses repr()

- Initial release
