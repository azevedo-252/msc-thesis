	The notes pitch 36 (C) and 37 (C#) insert a rest and a bar.
</dl>

<h2>abc midiin ?device?</h2>

Return or define the MIDI input device.
<p>
MIDI input works with OSS and/or ALSA on Unix and on MS windows.
<p>
With OSS, <i>device</i> is an external MIDI device name as '/dev/midi00'.
<p>
With ALSA, <i>device</i> is the MIDI client and port in the same format
as the option '-p' of <i>aplayrecord</i>, as '64:0'.
<p>
On MS Windows, <i>device</i> is a device number.
<p>
With the graphical interface (tkabc.tcl), edit the MIDI preferences
and right click on the MIDI input field to get a list of possible
devices.

<h2>abc midiload midifilename</h2>

Load a MIDI file and select the tune.
<p>
Any previous tune/file is discarded, even if it has been modified.

<h2>abc midiout ?device?</h2>

Return or define the MIDI output device.
<p>
MIDI output works with OSS and/or ALSA on Unix and on MS windows.
<p>
With OSS, <i>device</i> is the sequencer name possibly followed by
':' and a device number, as '/dev/sequencer:1'.
<p>
With ALSA, <i>device</i> is the MIDI client and port in the same format
as the option '-p' of <i>aplaymidi</i>.
<p>
On MS Windows, <i>device</i> is a device number.
<p>
With the graphical interface (tkabc.tcl), edit the MIDI preferences
and right click on the MIDI output field to get a list of possible
devices.

<h2>abc new</h2>

Load an empty tune and select it.
<p>
Any previous tune/file is discarded, even if it has been modified.

<h2>abc play ?args?</h2>

Play notes.
<p>
When no argument, return if playing is permitted or not. Otherwise,
<i>arg1</i> may be:
<dl>
  <dt>mute ?0/1?
  <dd>Get or set the voice mute state.
  <dt>note
  <dd>Play the current note.
  <dt>stop
  <dd>Stop playing.
  <dt>tempo
  <dd>Set the default tempo.
  <dt>tune
  <dd>Start playing from the current symbol.
  <dt>velocity ?value?
  <dd>Get or set the velocity/volume (0..127 - 0 = keyboard value / 80).
  <dt>which
  <dd>Return which symbol is being played or 'none'.
</dl>

<h2>abc record</h2>

Start/stop recording from the MIDI input port.
<p>
When recording is started, the command returns 1.
<p>
When recording is stopped, the command returns 0 if there was no MIDI
event. If there was some MIDI events, the command returns 2 after the
events have been translated to ABC and inserted in the tune.

<h2>abc rewind</h2>

Go to the first symbol of the first voice, and return its address.

<h2>abc set ?type? args</h2>

When no type, change a symbol definition.
<p>
The <i>args</i> is a single list of values in the same format as the one
returned by <i>get</i>.
<p>
Changing the number of sharps/flats of a key signature does a note
transposition up to the next key signature. Also, changing the main
key signature (the one in the tune header) transposes all voices.
<p>
When present, the <i>type</i> may be:
<dl>
  <dt>deco
  <dd>Set the decorations of the current symbol (note, rest or bar).
  <dt>flags
  <dd>Set the symbol flags. Actually, only the <i>space</i> flag may be
	changed.
  <dt>gchord
  <dd>Set the guitar chord indication of the current symbol.
  <dt>header
  <dd>Set the tune header (see <i>get header</i>). The previous header is
      completely destroyed.  Note that changing the key signature of th
	header does not do any tranposition.
  <dt>measure
  <dd>Insert or delete measure bars so that all measures are full according
	to the time signature.
  <dt>slurs
  <dd>Set the starting and ending slurs of the chord and of each note of
	the chord (four values if single note). To remove all slurs, set
	an empty value.
  <dt>ties

	(one value per head). To remove all ties, set an empty value.
  <dt>words
  <dd>Set the lyric words after the tune.
</dl>

current file, else, the argument may be:
<dl>
  <dt>delete
  <dd>Remove the current tune from the file.
  <dt>new
  <dd>Add a new tune in the file.
  <dt>a tune index
  <dd>Select the tune. The index is the same as the index in the list
	return by <i>abc tune</i> (this is not the value of X:).
</dl>

<h2>abc voice ?args?</h2>

With no argument, return the number of voices of the current tune, else,
the argument may be:
<dl>
  <dt>get
  <dd>Get the voice names. This command returns the name, full name and
	nick name of the voice as a list.
